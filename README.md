# FreeSQL
Object-Relational Mapping for applications

Introduction

The goal of this project is to allow the elimination of SQL commands in the development
of applications that use database access.

Using the decoration of attributes in the properties and classes associated with the
use of C # Reflection, allow the developer to only map the classes and their properties
with their names of the tables and fields, thus facilitating the generation of the
basic CRUD commands.

With the intense use of abstraction it is possible to migrate from one database system
to another only by modifying a few lines of code. In addition, it allows flexibility
in the user's choice of which database system he wants to use.

Versioning

The version information for any assembly in this project consists of the following
four values:

The Major and Minor version information follows the principles of the semantic
versioning contained in the site https://semver.org.

The Build Number information MUST follow the following format: YYMM, where YY 
is the year and MM is the month of build.

The Revision information also follows the principles of the semantic versioning
contained in the site https://semver.org.
